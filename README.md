Today, you will practice building out a professional-style wireframe document from a provided spec. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS. No additional frameworks or libraries can be utilized.

Professional wireframes are supposed to keep the presentation of the site simple without any additional content. The whole point of a wireframe is to get the layout figured out, while the real content can get added in the future. Wireframes allow the client to drive what layouts they like and what they donâ€™t like. Wireframes traditionally only contain:

Placeholder images
Filler text such as lorem ipsum
Placeholder images are a great resource inside a wireframe because they are simply placeholders with a size dependent on whatever the url is that you specified. Example: img src="https://place-hold.it/200x300/ddd" produces the following image, with a width of 200 pixels, a height, of 300 pixels, and color of #DDD, which is a light gray[^1]
